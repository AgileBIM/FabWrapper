# FabWrapper
Enables AutoCAD Lisp to dynamically interact with the Fabrication API



This project was originally posted as a download, but that link has since died. I've had requests to re-publish the work and GitHub seemed like the right place to avoid the problem in the future. This project is no longer under active development, but if someone wants to move the needle, let me know and I'll try to find some time to help.
